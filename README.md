## Tech

whatsapp-backend uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Express] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [Mongoose] - Elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
- [Pusher] - Powering realtime experiences for mobile and web

## Environment setup

- Add the `connectionURL` value in server.js. It should be the complete connection URL of the mongodb database that you're willing to use.
- Create an account on [Pusher], obtain credentials and use it to replace values for `pusher` in server.js file.
- Companion frontend repository is available here: [whatsapp-frontend](https://github.com/faizvasaya/whatsapp-frontend)

## Installation

whatsapp-backend requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd whatsapp-backend
npm i
nodemon server.js
```
